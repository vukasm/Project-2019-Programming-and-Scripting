# Project-2019-Programming-and-Scripting
Research Project on Iris Dataset for the module Programming and Scripting in Data Analytics course at GMIT. [See the instructions here:](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-pands/blob/master/project.pdf)

**Ronald Fisher** was a British statistician and genericist. For his work in statistics, he has been described as "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science".

Fisher's *Iris data set* (Fisher,) is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Iris is a genus of 260-300 species of flowering plants with showy flowers. The name comes from the Greek word for a rainbow, as the flower colours have a broad variety. 
The data set contains 3 classes of samples each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two, while the other two are not linearly separable from each other.
The data set contains the following attributes:
1.	Sepal length in cm
2.	Sepal width in cm
3.	Petal length in cm
4.	Petal width in cm
5.	Class:
-	*Iris Setosa*
-	*Iris Versicolour*
-	*Iris Virginica*



Fisher's Iris data set is available as csv file on multiple websites (for example, on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv). The goal of this project is to research the backround and data set itself and present different ways of analysing it by write a summary documentation and a code in Python programming language.
